Introduction to Algorithms with Scheme
--------------------------------------------------------------------

A book for aspiring and/or hobbyist programmers who want to learn the
most basic algorithms and data structures. We will use the Scheme
programming language because it forces the programmer to think
inductively and recursively. This way of thinking maps naturally onto
many common algorithms.

In addition, Scheme is simply badass.

In order to provide a rich programming environment, this book will use
the MIT/GNU Scheme implementation and Edwin, its integrated editor.
The project website puts it nicely: ``MIT/GNU Scheme is an
implementation of the Scheme programming language, providing an
interpreter, compiler, source-code debugger, integrated Emacs-like
editor, and a large runtime library.  MIT/GNU Scheme is best suited to
programming large applications with a rapid development cycle.'' For
more information, see http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/.
