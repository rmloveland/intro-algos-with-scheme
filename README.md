Introduction to Algorithms with Scheme
======================================

This book is for novice programmers who want to learn the most basic
algorithms and data structures. We will use the Scheme programming
language because it forces the programmer to think inductively and
recursively. This way of thinking maps naturally onto many common
algorithms.

In addition, Scheme is simply badass.
