* Overview

  Things to cover:

  - binary search
  - merge sort?
  - binary tree
    - csrm: constructor, selector, recognizer, mutator
    - creation
    - insertion
    - deletion
    - walking the tree (use higher-order fns, notes from aduni lectures)
  - sorting with treesort
    - this is only fast if tree is balanced, so give the ``slow
      version'' first, since balanced trees are not introduced yet
  - balanced binary trees
    - red-black tree (simpler than red-black to implement (?) but RB
      has superior tree rotation runtime)
    - now we can write the ``fast'' treesort!
  - graphs
    - represent data structure -- which representation?
    - 2-3 common algorithms: traversal, search
