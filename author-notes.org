* Outline


** 00 - Introduction


** 01 - Searching

Binary search


** 02 - Sorting

Merge sort


** 03 - Trees

Binary trees

CSRM: constructor, selector, recognizer, mutator

Basic operations

- creation
- insertion
- updating (destructive/in-place)
- deletion

Walking the tree

use higher-order fns, notes from aduni lectures

Sorting with treesort

this is only fast if tree is balanced, so give the ``slow version''
first, since balanced trees are not introduced yet

Balanced binary trees

red-black tree (avl tree is supposedly simpler than red-black to
implement (?) but RB has superior tree rotation runtime) - once we
have this we can write the ``fast'' treesort!


** 04 - Graphs

How to represent graphs with another data structure -- which
representation? Matrix, hash table -- we might want to implement our
own hash tables from bbt's first -- this would be way cool!

Common graph algorithms: traversal, search
